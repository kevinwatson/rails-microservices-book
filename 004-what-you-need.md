## What You Need

You'll need a computer that can run Docker Desktop. You'll also need an Internet connection if you want to download the code samples.

You can use all of the tools presented in this book for free. The software we'll use is either free or open source software that you can freely download and install.

The projects presented in this book were developed on a MacBook in a Docker Desktop container environment. The commands should work the same whether you're using Docker on Linux, Windows or macOS.
