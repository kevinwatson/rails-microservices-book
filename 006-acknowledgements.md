## Acknowledgements

I'd first like to thank my wife, Monica for her patience and understanding when I pursue my hobbies such as writing.

I'd like to thank my employer, [MX](https://mx.com), and the many people who have built this company for their expertise and many contributions to the Ruby on Rails ecosystem. They have published documentation and numerous Ruby gems which make building microservices on Ruby on Rails easy.

Special thanks goes to Chris Miller who has been my Ruby on Rails mentor over the course of several job changes. I'd also like to thank Igor Morgunov, Naoto Suzuki, Luilver Garces Brinas and Sheldon Teerlink for their feedback and contributions to this book.
